	abstract = {In this work we investigate whether the Kitaev honeycomb model can serve as a starting point to realize the intriguing physics of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. The starting point is to strain the system which leads to flat bands reminiscent of Landau levels, thereby quenching the kinetic energy. The presence of weak residual perturbations, such as Heisenberg interactions and the \${\textbackslash}gamma\$-term, creates effective interactions between the Majorana modes when projected into the flux-free sector. Taking into account a disordered boundary results in an interaction that is effectively random. While we find that in a strained nearest-neighbor Kitaev honeycomb model it is unlikely to find the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, it appears possible to realize a bipartite variant with similar properties. We furthermore argue that next-nearest-neighbor terms can lead to actual Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev physics, if large enough.},

We introduce and present some of the exact results obtained in Kitaev model. The Kitaev model embodies an unusual two spin interactions yet exactly solvable model in two dimension. This exact solvability renders it to realize many emergent many body phenomena such as \$Z\_2\$ gauge field, spin liquid states, spin fractionalization, topological order exactly. First we present the exact solution of Kitaev model using Majorana fermionisation and elaborate in detail the \$Z\_2\$ gauge structure. Following this we discuss exact calculation of magnetization, spin-spin correlation function establishing its spin-liquid character. Spin fractionalization and de-confinement of Majorana fermion is explained in detail. Existence of long range multi-spin correlation function and topological degeneracy are discussed to elucidate the entangled and topological nature of any eigenstate. Some elementary questionnaires are provided in appropriate places for assimilation of the technical details.},

We generalize SYK to include \$f\$ flavors of fermions, each occupying \$N\_a\$ sites and appearing with a \$q\_a\$ order in the interaction. Like SYK, this entire class of models generically has an infrared fixed point. We compute the infrared dimensions of the fermions, and the spectrum of singlet bilinear operators. We show that there is always a dimension-two operator in the spectrum, which implies that, like in SYK, there is breaking of conformal invariance and maximal chaos in the infrared four-point function of the generalized model. After a disorder average, the generalized model has a global \$O(N\_1) {\textbackslash}times O(N\_2) {\textbackslash}times {\textbackslash}ldots{\textbackslash}times O(N\_f)\$ symmetry: a subgroup of the \$O(N)\$ symmetry of SYK; thereby giving a richer spectrum. We also elucidate aspects of the large \$q\$ limit and the OPE, and solve \$q=2\$ SYK at finite \$N\$.},

However, even at a strongly chaotic point this model does not exhibit Lyapunov growth of the commutator squared of spin operators, as this observable saturates before exponential growth can manifest itself (even in situations where a spatial suppression factor makes the initial commutator small). We extend this model from the spin 1/2 Ising model to higher spins, demonstrate numerically that a window of exponential growth opens up for suﬃciently large spin, and extract a quantity which corresponds to a notion of a Lyapunov exponent. In the classical inﬁnite-spin limit, we identify and compute the appropriate classical analogue of the commutator squared, and show that the corresponding exponent agrees with the inﬁnite-spin limit extracted from the quantum spin chain.},

The goal is to give a language to the student in which to speak about quantum physics in more detail, and to start the student on a path of fluency in this language. On our journey we approach questions such as: -- You already know how to calculate the energy eigenstates of a single particle in a simple one-dimensional potential. How can such calculations be generalized to non-trivial potentials, higher dimensions, and interacting particles? -- You have heard that quantum mechanics describes our everyday world just as well as classical mechanics does, but have you ever seen an example where such behavior is calculated in detail and where the transition from classical to quantum physics is evident? -- How can we describe the internal spin structure of particles? How does this internal structure couple to the particles' motion? -- What are qubits and quantum circuits, and how can they be assembled to simulate a future quantum computer?},

The review is placed in the context of numerous experimental observations on correlated electron materials. Strong correlations in metals are often associated with their proximity to a Mott transition to an insulator created by the local Coulomb repulsion between the electrons. We explore the phase diagrams of a number of models of such local electronic correlation, employing a dynamical mean field theory in the presence of random spin exchange interactions. Numerical analyses and analytical solutions, using renormalization group methods and expansions in large spin degeneracy, lead to critical regions which display SYK physics. The models studied include the single-band Hubbard model, the \$t\$-\$J\$ model and the two-band Kondo-Heisenberg model in the presence of random spin exchange interactions. We also examine non-Fermi liquids obtained by considering each SYK model with random four fermion interactions to be a multi-orbital atom, with the SYK-atoms arranged in an infinite lattice. We connect to theories of sharp Fermi surfaces without any low-energy quasiparticles in the absence of spatial disorder, obtained by coupling a Fermi liquid to a gapless boson; a systematic large \$N\$ theory of such a critical Fermi surface, with SYK characteristics, is obtained by averaging over an ensemble of theories with random boson-fermion couplings. Finally, we present an overview of the links between the SYK model and quantum gravity and end with an outlook on open questions.},

For the ﬁrst two cases, OTOCs are periodic in time because of their commensurable energy spectra. For the circle and stadium billiards, they are not recursive but saturate to constant values which are linear in temperature. Although the stadium billiard is a typical example of the classical chaos, an expected exponential growth of the OTOC is not found. We also discuss the classical limit of the OTOC. Analysis of a time evolution of a wavepacket in a box shows that the OTOC can deviate from its classical value at a time much earlier than the Ehrenfest time.},

	abstract = {We study the generalization of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model to a 1 + 1 dimensional chiral SYK model of N ﬂavors of right-moving chiral Majorana fermions with all-to-all random 4-fermion interactions. The interactions in this model are exactly marginal, leading to an exact scaling symmetry. We show the Schwinger-Dyson equation of this model in the large N limit is exactly solvable. In addition, we show this model is integrable for small N ≤ 6 by bosonization. Surprisingly, the two point function in the large N limit has exactly the same form as that for N = 4, although the four point functions of the two cases are quite diﬀerent. The ground state entropy in the large N limit is the same as that of N free chiral Majorana fermions, leading to a zero ground state entropy density. The OTOC of the model in the large N limit exhibits a non-trivial spacetime structure reminscent of that found by Gu and Kitaev [1] for generic SYK-like models. Speciﬁcally we ﬁnd a Lyapunov regime inside an asymmetric butterﬂy cone, which are signatures of quantum chaos, and that the maximal velocity dependent Lyapunov exponent approaches the chaos bound 2π/β as the interaction strength approaches its physical upper bound. Finally, the model is integrable for (at least) N ≤ 6 but chaotic in the large N limit, leading us to conjecture that there is a transition from integrability to chaos as N increases past a critical value.},

	abstract = {Many-body chaos has emerged as a powerful framework for understanding thermalization in strongly interacting quantum systems. While recent analytic advances have sharpened our intuition for many-body chaos in certain large \$N\$ theories, it has proven challenging to develop precise numerical tools capable of exploring this phenomenon in generic Hamiltonians. To this end, we utilize massively parallel, matrix-free Krylov subspace methods to calculate dynamical correlators in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model for up to \$N = 60\$ Majorana fermions. We begin by showing that numerical results for two-point correlation functions agree at high temperatures with dynamical mean field solutions, while at low temperatures finite-size corrections are quantitatively reproduced by the exactly solvable dynamics of near extremal black holes. Motivated by these results, we develop a novel finite-size rescaling procedure for analyzing the growth of out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs). We verify that this procedure accurately determines the Lyapunov exponent, \${\textbackslash}lambda\$, across a wide range in temperatures, including in the regime where \${\textbackslash}lambda\$ approaches the universal bound, \${\textbackslash}lambda = 2{\textbackslash}pi/{\textbackslash}beta\$.},

The reservoir is kept at zero temperature and charge neutrality. We find that the dynamics of the discharging process of the SYK quantum dot reveals a distinctive characteristic of the SYK non-Fermi liquid (nFl) state. In particular, we focus on the tunneling current induced by the quench. We show that the temperature dependent contribution to the current's half-life scales linearly in \$T\$ at low temperatures for the SYK nFl state, while for the Fermi liquid it scales as \$T{\textasciicircum}2\$.},

We study in detail charge transport signatures of the unique non-Fermi liquid state of such a quantum dot coupled to non-interacting leads. The properties of this setup depend essentially on the ratio \$p\$ between the number of transverse modes in the lead \$M\$ and the number of the fermion degrees of freedom \$N\$ on the SYK dot. This ratio can be tuned via the magnetic field applied to the dot. Our proposed setup gives access to the non-trivial conformal-invariant regime associated with the SYK model as well as a more conventional Fermi-liquid regime via tuning the field. The dimensionless linear response conductance acquires distinct \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{p\}\$ and \$1/{\textbackslash}sqrt\{p\}\$ dependencies for the two phases respectively in the low-temperature limit, with a universal jump at the transition. We find that corrections scale linearly and quadratically in either temperature or frequency on the two sides of the transition. In the weak tunneling regime we find differential conductance proportional to the inverse square root of the applied voltage bias \$U\$. This dependence is replaced by a conventional Ohmic behavior with constant conductance proportional to \$1/{\textbackslash}sqrt\{T\}\$ for bias energy \$eU\$ smaller than temperature scale \$k\_BT\$. We also describe the out-of-equilibrium current-bias characteristics and discuss various crossovers between the limiting behaviors mentioned above.},

abstract={Could it be that the matter from the electrons in high Tc superconductors is of a radically new kind that may be called "many body entangled compressible quantum matter"? Much of this text is intended as an easy to read tutorial, explaining recent theoretical advances that have been unfolding at the cross roads of condensed matter- and string theory, black hole physics as well as quantum information theory. These developments suggest that the physics of such matter may be governed by surprisingly simple principles. My real objective is to present an experimental strategy to test critically whether these principles are actually at work, revolving around the famous linear resistivity characterizing the strange metal phase. The theory suggests a very simple explanation of this "unreasonably simple" behavior that is actually directly linked to remarkable results from the study of the quark gluon plasma formed at the heavy ion colliders: the "fast hydrodynamization" and the "minimal viscosity". This leads to high quality predictions for experiment: the momentum relaxation rate governing the resistivity relates directly to the electronic entropy, while at low temperatures the electron fluid should become unviscous to a degree that turbulent flows can develop even on the nanometre scale.},

	abstract = {We study a sparse version of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model defined on random hypergraphs constructed either by a random pruning procedure or by randomly sampling regular hypergraphs. The resulting model has a new parameter, \$k\$, defined as the ratio of the number of terms in the Hamiltonian to the number of degrees of freedom, with the sparse limit corresponding to the thermodynamic limit at fixed \$k\$. We argue that this sparse SYK model recovers the interesting global physics of ordinary SYK even when \$k\$ is of order unity. In particular, at low temperature the model exhibits a gravitational sector which is maximally chaotic. Our argument proceeds by constructing a path integral for the sparse model which reproduces the conventional SYK path integral plus gapped fluctuations. The sparsity of the model permits larger scale numerical calculations than previously possible, the results of which are consistent with the path integral analysis. Additionally, we show that the sparsity of the model considerably reduces the cost of quantum simulation algorithms. This makes the sparse SYK model the most efficient currently known route to simulate a holographic model of quantum gravity. We also define and study a sparse supersymmetric SYK model, with similar conclusions to the non-supersymmetric case. Looking forward, we argue that the class of models considered here constitute an interesting and relatively unexplored sparse frontier in quantum many-body physics.},
