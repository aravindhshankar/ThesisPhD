The equations are independent of temperature which enters only through the initial conditions for the correlations. The equations are valid for the (general) inhomogeneous case in which the exchange coupling as well as the magnetic field depend on the sites in the chain. In the derivation use is made of a general formulation of the thermodynamic Wick theorem. For the homogeneous case a nonlinear differential-difference equation is derived, generalizing the Painlevé III equation found previously at zero temperature in the scaling limit. The finite-temperature field theory limit is discussed also."}

	abstract = {We analyse the fusion, braiding and scattering properties of discrete non-abelian anyons. These occur in (2+1)-dimensional theories where a gauge group G is spontaneously broken down to some discrete subgroup H. We identify the quantumnumbers of the electrically and magnetically charged sectors of the remaining discrete gauge theory, and show that on the quantum level the symmetry group H̄ is extended to the (quasi-triangular) Hopf algebra D(H̄). A conjugacy class paired with a centralizer representation forms an irreducible representation. The fusion rules for arbitrary discrete non-abelian anyons are completely determined by the nontrivial comultiplication (i.e. tensorproduct) of this algebra. It allows for a clear interpretation of Cheshire charge. Also the braid-matrix R, which determines the statistical properties and the two particle Aharonov-Bohm scattering, is fixed and satisfies the Yang-Baxter equation. Most of our considerations are relevant for discrete gauge theories in (3+1)-dimensional space time as well.}

We find that the answer is properly that the superconducting state exhibits topological order in the sense of Wen, i.e., that while it lacks a local order parameter, it is sensitive to the global topology of the underlying manifold and exhibits an associated fractionalization of quantum numbers. We show that this perspective unifies a number of previous observations on superconductors and their low lying excitations and that this complex can be elegantly summarized in a purely topological action of the “BF” type and its elementary quantization. On manifolds with boundaries, the BF action correctly predicts non-chiral edge states, gapped in general, but crucial for fractionalization and establishing the ground state degeneracy. In all of this the role of the physical electromagnetic fields is central. We also observe that the BF action describes the topological order in several other physically distinct systems thus providing an example of topological universality.}

	abstract = {Constructing agents with planning capabilities has long been one of the main challenges in the pursuit of artificial intelligence. Tree-based planning methods have enjoyed huge success in challenging domains, such as chess1 and Go2, where a perfect simulator is available. However, in real-world problems, the dynamics governing the environment are often complex and unknown. Here we present the MuZero algorithm, which, by combining a tree-based search with a learned model, achieves superhuman performance in a range of challenging and visually complex domains, without any knowledge of their underlying dynamics. The MuZero algorithm learns an iterable model that produces predictions relevant to planning: the action-selection policy, the value function and the reward. When evaluated on 57 different Atari games3---the canonical video game environment for testing artificial intelligence techniques, in which model-based planning approaches have historically struggled4---the MuZero algorithm achieved state-of-the-art performance. When evaluated on Go, chess and shogi---canonical environments for high-performance planning---the MuZero algorithm matched, without any knowledge of the game dynamics, the superhuman performance of the AlphaZero algorithm5 that was supplied with the rules of the game.},

	abstract = {Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1--4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence---the structure prediction component of the `protein folding problem'8---has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10--14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

	abstract = {Elucidating the behavior of quantum interacting systems of many particles remains one of the biggest challenges in physics. Traditional numerical methods often work well, but some of the most interesting problems leave them stumped. Carleo and Troyer harnessed the power of machine learning to develop a variational approach to the quantum many-body problem (see the Perspective by Hush). The method performed at least as well as state-of-the-art approaches, setting a benchmark for a prototypical two-dimensional problem. With further development, it may well prove a valuable piece in the quantum toolbox. Science, this issue p. 602; see also p. 580 A machine-learning approach sets a computational benchmark for a prototypical two-dimensional problem. The challenge posed by the many-body problem in quantum physics originates from the difficulty of describing the nontrivial correlations encoded in the exponential complexity of the many-body wave function. Here we demonstrate that systematic machine learning of the wave function can reduce this complexity to a tractable computational form for some notable cases of physical interest. We introduce a variational representation of quantum states based on artificial neural networks with a variable number of hidden neurons. A reinforcement-learning scheme we demonstrate is capable of both finding the ground state and describing the unitary time evolution of complex interacting quantum systems. Our approach achieves high accuracy in describing prototypical interacting spins models in one and two dimensions.}}

Troyer, Science 355 (2017) 602], we construct the neural-network quantum state of transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) by an unsupervised machine learning method. Such a wave function is a map from the spin-configuration space to the complex number field determined by an array of network parameters. To get the ground state of the system, values of the network parameters are calculated by a Stochastic Reconfiguration (SR) method. We provide for this SR method an understanding from action principle and information geometry aspects. With this quantum state, we calculate key observables of the system, the energy, correlation function, correlation length, magnetic moment, and susceptibility. As innovations, we provide a high efficiency method and use it to calculate entanglement entropy (EE) of the system and get results consistent with previous work very well.}

The resulting phase diagram is in reasonable agreement with that obtained by other methods. These other methods (Monte Carlo and 1N expansions) are, however, most sensitive to first-order phase transitions while our method is most sensitive to continuous phase transitions.

In this paper, we demonstrate that what a Gibbs sampler converges to is a function of the order of the sampling scheme.

	abstract = {Advances in experimental neuroscience have transformed our ability to explore the structure and function of neural circuits. At the same time, advances in machine learning have unleashed the remarkable computational power of artificial neural networks (ANNs). While these two fields have different tools and applications, they present a similar challenge: namely, understanding how information is embedded and processed through high-dimensional representations to solve complex tasks. One approach to addressing this challenge is to utilize mathematical and computational tools to analyze the geometry of these high-dimensional representations, i.e., neural population geometry. We review examples of geometrical approaches providing insight into the function of biological and artificial neural networks: representation untangling in perception, a geometric theory of classification capacity, disentanglement, and abstraction in cognitive systems, topological representations underlying cognitive maps, dynamic untangling in motor systems, and a dynamical approach to cognition. Together, these findings illustrate an exciting trend at the intersection of machine learning, neuroscience, and geometry, in which neural population geometry provides a useful population-level mechanistic descriptor underlying task implementation. Importantly, geometric descriptions are applicable across sensory modalities, brain regions, network architectures, and timescales. Thus, neural population geometry has the potential to unify our understanding of structure and function in biological and artificial neural networks, bridging the gap between single neurons, population activities, and behavior.},

The effective Hamiltonian is then employed in Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the average energy and magnetization in the longitudinal and transverse directions. Comparison with exact results on a one-dimensional chain shows that the method works quite well. Monte Carlo results for the average energy, specific heat, and the transverse and longitudinal components of the magnetization for the transverse Ising model on the simple cubic lattice are presented.},

In this paper we demonstrate how this approach can be used to investigate numerically the ground state of a lattice gauge theory. More concretely, we explicitly carry out the variational Monte Carlo procedure based on such contraction methods for a pure gauge Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian with a \$\textbackslash mathbb\{Z\}\_3\$ gauge field in two spatial dimensions. This is a first proof of principle to the method, which provides an inherent way to increase the number of variational parameters and can be readily extended to systems with physical fermions.},

When the Higgs fields transform like some representation other than the fundamental, a phase boundary may exist. This is the case for SU(N) with all the Higgs fields in the adjoint representation and for U(1) with all the Higgs fields in the charge-N(N{$>$}1) representation. We present an argument due to Wegner that indicates the stability of the pure gauge transition. Another phase, free charge or Coulomb, is generally present.

We implement this scheme explicitly within the Stochastic Series expansion as well as within path-integral Monte Carlo, and apply it to quantum spin and quantum rotor models.

For ferromagnetic Ising interactions, we resolve the limiting regimes known from field theory, ranging from the nearest-neighbor Ising to the long-range Gaussian universality classes, as well as the intermediate regime with continuously varying critical exponents. In the long-range Gaussian regime, we treat the effect of dangerous irrelevant variables on finite-size scaling forms. For antiferromagnetic and therefore competing Ising interactions, the stochastic series expansion algorithm displays growing auto-correlation times leading to a reduced performance. Nevertheless, our results are consistent with the nearest-neighbor Ising universality for all investigated interaction ranges both on the linear chain and the square lattice.},

Focusing on the special case of Z2 gauge group on a periodically identified square lattice, the equivariant architecture is analytically shown to contain the loop-gas solution as a special case.

	abstract = {The simplest topologically ordered phase in 2+1D is the deconfined phase of \$Z\_2\$ gauge theory, realized for example in the toric code. This phase permits a duality that exchanges electric and magnetic excitations (``\$e\$'' and ``\$m\$'' particles). Condensing either particle while the other remains gapped yields a phase transition with 3D Ising exponents. More mysterious, however, is the transition out of the deconfined phase when self-duality symmetry is preserved. If this transition is continuous, which has so far been unclear, then it may be the simplest critical point for which we still lack any useful continuum Lagrangian description. This transition also has a soft matter interpretation, as a multicritical point for classical membranes in 3D. We study the self-dual transition with Monte Carlo simulations of the \$Z\_2\$ gauge-Higgs model on cubic lattices of linear size \$L\textbackslash leq 96\$. Our results indicate a continuous transition: for example, cumulants show a striking parameter-free scaling collapse. We estimate scaling dimensions by using duality symmetry to distinguish the leading duality-odd/duality-even scaling operators \$A\$ and \$S\$. All local operators have large scaling dimensions, making standard techniques for locating the critical point ineffective. We develop an alternative using ``renormalization group trajectories'' of cumulants. We check that two- and three-point functions, and temporal correlators in the Monte-Carlo dynamics, are scale-invariant, with scaling dimensions \$x\_A\$ and \$x\_S\$ and dynamical exponent \$z\$. We also give a picture for emergence of 1-form symmetries, in some parts of the phase diagram, in terms of ``patching'' of membranes/worldsurfaces. We relate this to the percolation of anyon worldlines in spacetime. Analyzing percolation yields a fourth exponent for the self-dual transition. We propose variations of the model for further investigation.},
