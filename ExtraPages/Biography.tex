I was born on September 26th, 1996 in Chennai, a big city in the south of India. After finishing high school, I went to West Bengal for a five-year integrated Bachelor-Master program in Physics at the Indian Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur.
\par
During this period, I took courses in several areas of physics and engineering, including high energy physics and gravitational physics, with my favorite being condensed matter and statistical physics. I was also fortunate to get an early start at doing my own research by being selected for several internships throughout my bachelor and master studies. With Prof. Pinaki Sengupta at NTU Singapore, I worked on writing my first quantum Monte Carlo code to investigate the Heisenberg XXZ model on ladder-like systems. I then worked briefly with Prof. Barbara Terhal and Prof. Fabian Hassler on DMRG simulations at RTWH aachen, and then on numerical and analytical studies on the Anderson model on the Bethe lattice with Prof. Antonello Scardicchio at the ICTP, Trieste, looking for signatures of anomalous diffusion. I concluded my master studies with a thesis titled ''Disordered Superconductors'', working with Prof. Sudhansu Sekhar Mandal. 
\par
I continued my master's degree in Belgrade. Still, I did most of my thesis work at the Institute of Physics under the supervision of Milica MilovanoviÄ‡. 
%The title of my master's thesis is: ``Lattice-like structures in Lowest Landau Level'' where we were trying to construct an effective Hamiltonian for a bosonic system on a square lattice that will support fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) at $\nu=\frac{1}{2}$.
I started my Ph.D. in November 2018, in the Quantum Matter Theory Group at the Lorentz Institute of Leiden University, under the supervision of Prof. Dr. J. Zaanen and Prof. Dr. K.E. Schalm. During my Ph.D., I taught a couple of courses as a teaching assistant, ``Classical Electrodynamics'' and ``Theory of General Relativity''. Alongside the research, I have attended several schools during my Ph.D., DRSTP Schools in High Energy and Condensed Matter Physics, in Brazil and the Netherlands. I have also presented my work at several Physics@Veldhoven conferences.


As of January 1st, 2023, I have started working as a Quantitative Developer for an energy trading company Northpool B.V.
