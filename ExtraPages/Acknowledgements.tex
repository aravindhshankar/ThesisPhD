This thesis is a culmination of all the work done and events that happened since I moved to the Netherlands. First, I would like to thank Jan Zaanen and Koenraad Schalm for their guidance on this journey and all the knowledge they shared during that time. 
\par
Even though there is a single name on this thesis, people in my research group have helped me a lot through numerous discussions, code debugging, and brainstorming; thank you a lot, in no particular order, Vladimir Ohanesjan, Aravindh Swaminathan Shankar, Floris Balm, Nicolas Chagnet, Tereza Vakhtel, Philippe Sabella-Garnier, Kevin Grosvenor, Vincenzo Scopelliti and Aurelio Romero-Bermudez. Also, thank you for making these years in Leiden very enjoyable.
\par
I would also like to express my gratitude to my friends, with whom I have also discussed some of the problems that I've encountered while working on this thesis, thank you Marko Kuzmanović, Daniel Szilagyi, Ognjen Stanisavljević and Dušan Drobnjak.
\par
I also want to thank the support staff, the secretariat, and the IT of the Lorentz Institute and LION for their help. I would also like to thank the surfSARA, Alice cluster, and Xmaris personnel for the access to their compute resources, without which none of the results in this thesis would be possible.
\par
And finally, from the bottom of my heart, I would like to thank my mom, dad, and brother for all the support they gave me. Without you, none of this would be possible. Puno vam hvala!
